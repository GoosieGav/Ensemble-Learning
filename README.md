# Jame and Gav 2025 OSEF Project# OSEF-2025

This project was developed for the Ozarks Science and Engineering Fair (OSEF) and focuses on malware detection using ensemble learning techniques. By combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), and Transformers, the system enhances feature representation diversity to improve the accuracy and reliability of malware classification. The model is trained and tested using the MalMem 2022 dataset, with a focus on real-world cybersecurity applications.
